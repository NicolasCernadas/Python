~ LIBRARY: MATH
  "Import math" to call
~ We can decide how to call the library when needed with "as", like "import math as m", and now call the functions like that; ex: print (m.floor(value))
~ a few functions:
    print(math.ceil(value)): rounds up
    print(math.floor(value)): rounds down
    print(math.sqrt(value)): square root
    print(round(value))
    print(abs(value)): absolute value (how far its from 0)
    print(pow(value, number)): value powered to number
    print(max/min(value1, value2, value3)): max/min value of a list
