~ print(type(variable name)): returns variable type
~ name = "nicolas". // not necessary to specify variable type
~ name, age, male, female = "nicolas", 21, true, false // can create multiple variables in one line, following the order separated by comas (this is called 'Multiple Assignment')
  If they all have the same value: age_1, age_2, age_3 = 21
~ name = "nicolas"
  age = 21
  print("your name is: " + (name) + ", and your age is: " + str(age))
  This will print: 'Your name is nicolas, and your age is 21' without a problem, we are converting age's type to string and concatenating with "+".
~ print(len(variable name)): variable length
~ print(name.find("character to find"): finds a character within a string
~ print(name.capitalize())
~ print(name.upper())
~ print(name.lower())
~ print(name.isdigit()): returns 'true' or 'false' whether or not is a digit ("123") !(only works for string variables)!
~ print(name.isalpha()): returns 'true' or 'false' whether or the content are alphabetical character ("abc") !(not spaces, not numbers)!
~ print(name.count("character to count"))
~ print(name.replace("character to replace", "what to replace it for"))
~ print(name*3): !(we can multiply string variables)!this will return (namenamename)
~ input("what is your name?"): users input 
  we can use it like this:
  name = input("whats your name?: ")
  age = int(input("how old are you?: ")): both in this and the next one, we are changing the value of the input to an int or float
  hight = float(input("how tall are you?: ")
